                    We believe if we categorize default lists of words according to Vanessa's needs, she will save free
                        time by not learning words she might not use in the future. <br><br>

                        We believe if we develop an easy system to manage her study time in the app depending on her
                        life’s commitments she won't miss a single day without learning or reviewing words.
                        <br><br>

                        We believe if we design a feature that allows her to highlight or categorize words in a
                        different list of topics, she wouldn't spend a lot of time searching for the words she is
                        interested to learn.

                        information and visualized her actions, I sketched wireframes and created a low-fidelity

                        focusing on how easy the apps are to use and if they accomplish their up goals.

                        levels can
                        be easily seen at one glance and while advancing on the app, more words and levels are unlocked.
                        This app also encourages users by praising them when finishing a level.
                        Cons
                        : There are no onboarding screens and the learning method is monotone and boring because it only
                        has one kind of exercise.

                        overall
                        progression of the user. Each word has a definition, synonyms, and examples. One can set
                        reminders and goals that help users stay on track.
                        Cons
                        : Its examples as just extracts of videos and songs, meaning that visual examples would be a
                        good addition. Reminders are just focused on daily routines but don't consider location or
                        weekends.

                        realizing in some words, there are short games to reinforce what has been learned.
                        Cons
                        : Its words only include a translation. However, examples, images, and synonyms must be filled
                        in by the user. If a mistake was saved while editing a word, there is no ‘’reset to default’’

                            Now I am more conscious of the perspective that nothing is fixed and everything can be improved
                            if I embrace the process.

                            The idea that users are the center of every design decision strengthened my passion for
                            developing great products for people.
