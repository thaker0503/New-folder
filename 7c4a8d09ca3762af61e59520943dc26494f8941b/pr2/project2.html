                    In order to meet the brief, the app will focus on 4
                    components:
                    <br> <br>

                    Offering a single view of all ongoing projects and sub-projects visible at all times through a
                    panelavailable on the left of the screen <br>
                    Allowing users to create teams: this component ensures task assignment clarity and
                    communication(through the possibility for users to post comments) <br>
                    Allowing users to see at one glance — on a specific tab called “Pyramid” — a timeline all ongoing
                    projects and their dependencies. Users will also be offered the option to export project timelines
                    on their own calendar. <br>
                    Digital coach helping users to focus on their own goals. The idea is to ask users to fill out a
                    short questionnaire to help them defining personal or group goals and congratulate them when these
                    goals are met. <br> <br>

                    the project was to create a simple, comprehensive and versatile project management tool allowing
                    people to work both on personal and professional projects.
                    The main challenge was to design a web app able to offer a strong differentiator in a very
                    competitive project management tools landscape.

                    MyProject allows users to have a single view of all ongoing projects and sub-projects available at
                    any time - via a double fixed vertical menu and an horizontal navigation bar.

                    As a next step, if this project had to be implemented, it would be interesting to focus on
                    usability, user testing and to develop additional features — such as a chat to enable teams to
                    communicate around a project for example. </span><span class="e20_499">Conclusion
