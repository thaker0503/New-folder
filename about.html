            I'm originally from sunny Greece and I have been based in Liverpool since 2016. <br>

            I'm currently working at a tech start-up as a UX/UI designer, focusing on a document and workflow automation web app and I have a background as a front end developer. <br>

            As a result of my roles in UX/UI design, I know how to curate great user experiences for digital environments and how to communicate my ideas to different groups effectively. <br>

            I enjoy every phase of the creative process, from brainstorming with my team to solving complex problems that help the users, and I am always willing to expand my knowledge by taking more courses and having conversations with experienced professionals. <br>

            Studies have been self-directed, through online courses, podcasts, seminars, and I have been named among the top 1% UX course performers at the Interaction Design Foundation. <br>

            I love solving problems and always get a tease from friends when I try to bring them to yet another escape room.</span>
